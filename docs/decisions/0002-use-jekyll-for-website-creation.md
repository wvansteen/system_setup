## Context and Problem Statement

We want to write our documentation in normal formats without worrying about how it will be displayed on the documentation website.  What is the best way to get documentation onto the website?

## Decision Drivers

* Ease of use
* Ability to work with 'normal' documentation

## Considered Options

* Jekyll
* Docusaurus
* Gastby
* Hexo

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Jekyll", because it is the default static website builder for Github Pages and supports writing documentation in Markdown.  It has all the features to get going and can easily be switched away from later if needed.
